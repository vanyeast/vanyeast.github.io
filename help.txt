How the website works:

We use markdown (.md) files to format the content for individual pages.
Then, we use gitbook to build the html files for the website.

To make changes to the website (code is in ` `):
0) You'll need a) method of accessing github b) a shell
1) Clone the vanyeast.github.io repository
2) Make changes to the markdown files.
2b) Alternatively, use github online text editor to change and preview markdown files.
3) Go the the main directory and `gitbook build`. This creates a folder _book, containing all the html files in structured directories.
4) `cp -R ./_book/* ./` This copies all the files out into the main directory.
5) `rm -R _book` Clean up.
6) Commit changes on your local directory, and push it to the website. Changes should be live!
